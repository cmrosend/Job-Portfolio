# Professional Work
I first became interested in engineering 

As an engineer, I want to be able to do something that leaves a mark on the world. I figured this best could be done through the newly emerging field of additive manufacturing. My current goal is to further my knowledge of additive manufacturing, whether that is through researching at grad school or hands on through work in the field.

# Free Time
In my free time, I've been recently enjoing going indoor climbing with my girlfriend. It's something that challenges me and makes me have more trust in myself, plus its really fun. Its so satisfying getting to the top and jumping all the way down, seeing all the progress during the fall.
