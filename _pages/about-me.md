# Myself
Im Chris, an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering major at Virginia Tech. To say hello or ask me a question, feel free to take a look at my [contact page](/contact/).

# My Professional Work
I am currently working my way through a bachelors degree at Virginia Tech and am in my last semester. Going through the curriculum, I've learned that I enjoy being able to apply what I learn in my classes instead of just absorbing it and never using it again. This had led me to my [research in the DREAMS Lab](/2023/08/24/ldpe-recycling.html) and to [e-NABLE at VT](/2022/09/16/enable-at-virginia-tech.html). 

Compounded with my previous interest in 3D printing, I've decided to try and enter the field of Additive Manufacturing. It interests me the most due to the amount of groundbreaking research still being done to this day, meaning that I could affect the field one day. My current goal is to learn more about AM, whether it is from going to grad school to continue to research, or to get my toes wet in the field directly.

# My Free Time
In my free time, I've been recently enjoing going indoor rock climbing with my girlfriend. It's something that challenges me and makes me have more trust in myself, plus its really fun. Its so satisfying getting to the top and jumping all the way down, seeing all the progress during the fall. Currently only at a V1-2 level since the gym near me is surprisingly hard.

When I'm hanging around at home I like to relax with my small but growing vinyl collection and either play some video games or learn more piano. Top 3 bands would probably have to be Joywave, IDKHow, and Half-Alive in that order. As for video games, Into the Breach is always my go-to reccomend since no one has heard of it despite it being the best strategy game I've ever played.

I made that shelf myself by the way, and it is surprisingly sturdy for some scrap wood just stained and nailed together. It might get replaced in the future since it sadly doesn't fit the player and receiver, but it works for now.
