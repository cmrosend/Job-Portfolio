# Myself
Im Chris, an graduate from Virginia Tech, majored in Mechanical Engineering. To say hello or ask me a question, feel free to take a look at my [contact page](/contact/).

# My Professional Work
After graduating Virginia Tech, I wanted to do something that would further my knowledge of the additive manufacturing field. That led me to Strategy Milling, a company specializing in milling dental restorations. Learning about the capabilities of milling and its limitations has been valuable as it lets me design parts for 3D printing in ways that are unique to that medium and cannot be recreated any other way. Taking everything I learned from Strategy Milling I am currently looking to apply my knowledge to new roles and learn more about what I want out of career.

# My Free Time
In my free time, I've been recently enjoing going indoor rock climbing. It's something that challenges me and makes me have more trust in myself, plus its really fun. Its so satisfying getting to the top and jumping all the way down, seeing all the progress during the fall. Currently at a V3 level if anyone is interested in joining me!

When I'm hanging around at home I like to relax with my small but growing vinyl collection and either play some video games or learn more piano. Top 3 bands would probably have to be Joywave, IDKHow, and Half-Alive in that order. As for video games, Into the Breach is always my go-to reccomend since no one has heard of it despite it being the best strategy game I've ever played.

I made that shelf myself by the way, and it is surprisingly sturdy for some scrap wood just stained and nailed together. It might get replaced in the future since it sadly doesn't fit the player and receiver, but it works for now.
