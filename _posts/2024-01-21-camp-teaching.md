## What is it?

This was a program I did back in sophomore year of college where I would go to a camp and offer to give a talk about 3D printing to interested camp students. I would talk about how FFF printing works and have some kids ask questions, then I would have them draw out a design and print it for them. I really liked showing the kids that anything they could draw could be made and I wanted to try and inspire them a little bit.

## What have I done?

The talk I gave mainly went over how FFF and resin printing worked, describing them mainly by saying how they added ontop of each other instead of getting rid of things. It was hard finding terms that grade-schoolers knew, so I mainly used the analogy of legos. It was hard wrangling their attention because they would much rather be doing something else, but promising them something fun at the end of the meeting seemed to work.

In total, I made parts for about 25 kids, most of which can be seen in the picture with the table. I took the designs that the kids drew on paper and used either FFF or resin printing as well as Fusion 360 to model and print them. It was a very fun exercise for both brushing up on CAD skills, as well as developing completely new models. Working with abstract concepts allows me to make whatever I want, and one of my favorite ones was the penguin beyblade I got to make. The kids were so excited to see the final parts, but some actually were a little dissapointed when they got it which surprised me. All parts in the pictures below were my favorite to design since they made me learn different techniques for making them.

## What have I learned from this?

<ins>Experience</ins>

* Use of an Ender 3 and Elegoo Mars
* Use of Fusion 360 to model abstract designs
* Presentation skills towards those unfamiliar with your work

<ins>Concepts</ins>

* What the customer says they want is not always what they want, some interpretation is needed to deliver the product they had intended
* You need to be able to explain what you are doing to someone with little to no knowledge in a way that makes sense, or else they arent going to be interested in it
* Sometimes people wonâ€™t like what you make and youll have to accept that by being better next time
