## What is it?

This is a research project that I personally started in the DREAMS Lab. It involves the recycling of used low density polyethylene, plastic bags, into a filament usable within FFF printers. The idea stemmed from the “bag of bags” that everyone has in their home since mine was getting unruly, and the fact that polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is already a commercial printing material. After doing research, it was determined that while PE is a hard material to use due to its semi-crystalline nature, it is still something that should be possible and that the project is worth a shot. The DREAMS Lab provided us with a shredder, filament machine, and guidance through our GTA Henry.

## What have I done?

The end goal of the project is to have a spool of PE that prints well enough that strength tests can be performed. Currently, my partner Justin and I have progressed through the stages of: Learning how to print a spool, figuring out a the shredding process, and acquiring the correct material.

<ins>Work completed in these stages:</ins>

-  Finding contacts that have access to the tools we need
-  Sourcing material to be shredded in the shredder provided to us
-  Testing what kind of prints shred better than others
-  Putting the shreds through the spooling process and seeing if they are suitable
-  Taking notes and improving the process to make spool diameter more consistent
-  Testing the created spool and take notes on what is wrong
-  Experimenting with different methods of melting LDPE

<ins>The work that is expected to be completed by the end of May:</ins>

-  Transition spool creation from PLA to PE
-  Figure out a process that allows PE to shred into pieces like PLA
-  Create a PE spool using the experience from the PLA spool
-  Test the tensile bars using an Instrom machine

## What have I learned from this?

<ins>Experience</ins>

* Use of a Filabot spooler
* Use of a Prusa MINI
* Proper way to locate and read research papers
* The research process, from idea to finished product

<ins>Concepts</ins>

If something doesn’t go the way you wanted it to, you should step back and approach it from another angle
Don’t just assume something is going to work because it would be good if it does
Making something takes a lot more time and effort than expected
