## What is it?

e-NABLE is an global community of “Digital Humanitarian” volunteers who use their 3D printers to make free and low-cost prosthetic upper limb devices for children and adults in need. At Virginia Tech, we have our own chapter which seeks to help people and animals alike in the New River Valley region.

## What have I done?

I have been part of e-NABLE at Virginia Tech for 3 semesters and have become Chief Engineer in that time. This means that I supervise 3 teams and ensure they stay on track and provide design assistance as needed. In these three years, have worked with three patients so far; A child in Salem named Charli who was missing all four limbs from birth, a girl in Blacksburg named Maya who has a muscle disorder preventing her from doing normal activities, and a Dog named Holly in Ohio who is missing their back leg. We also work with local clinics to develop medical devices for training.

## My work includes:

1. Designing a harness that simulates a thigh to help Holly balance better in the car (Current work).
2. Replicating the feel of a hand skeleton using 3D printing so surgeons can practice difficult procedures without using cadavers.
3. Developing a 3D printable neonatal rib cage so that doctors can practice CPR on newborns.
4. Helping restructure the club in a way that promotes progress, documentation, and comradery.
5. Working with first-years and teaching them sustainable design principles, ensuring they establish and maintain semester goals, and providing assistance when it comes to next steps.

Outside of my direct work, the teams I supervise include:

TTAC: A 7 person team dedicated to making assistive devices for the community, such as key guards and maps for the blind.

Static Team: An 8 person team dedicated to creating and uploading prosthetic devices to the e-NABLE Hub.

The Mya Team: A 13 person team dedicated to enhancing Maya’s daily life by creating devices that give her exercise and allow her family to interact with her better. Currently, they are working on a bike that gets Maya to exercise as she rides

## What have I learned from this?

<ins>Experience</ins>

* Designing for 3D printing using Solidworks
* Designing while keeping the user in mind
* Leadership skills such as: Delegation, Coaching, Time management

<ins>Concepts</ins>

* The importance of having something to show each week
* That leadership is about promoting comradery within the team you lead and acting as a rock that they can rely on
