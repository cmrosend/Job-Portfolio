What is it?

This was a project that I started over the summer of the pandemic to keep myself busy and to figure out how to use my new 3D printer. I named it MarechiStudio after something I read in a comic; it means the irresistible studio essentially. I used this store to design my own unique products and to learn the basics of 3D printing.
What have I done?

Starting in 2020 the store ran until around the beginning of 2022, where I was too overwhelmed with classes and the hassles of producing and shipping products in a dorm room to continue. I’ve wanted to start it back up now that I have a lot more time on my hands since it was fairly popular. I had over 2000 shop visits and 24 orders between 2020-21 which netted me a nice little bit of spending cash for other hobbies.
I liked designing things that took advantage of the 3D printing aspect of things, so stuff that either looked nice or had mechanisms in it. The main one i’m proud of making is the potion mister, pictured below. It was an original idea on Etsy (which is surprisingly hard to think of by the way) and it was just a potion that worked similarly to how it did in the show. Version 1 used a non-3D printed part, the mister, and based the whole design around it. It worked decently, but it was hard to hold, spray, and refill since it was 5 parts that needed to be removed and replaced. I took these criticisms and started designing Version 2, which worked by using a ball and pump mechanism that I had done field research on.
The first thing I designed, which is the house from animal crossing. It uses a hinge on the door that is printed with the base, and the roof is removable.

What have I learned from this?

Experience

    Basics of tolerances when it comes to 3D printed parts
    Design of 3D printed mechanisms
    Logistics of shipping, packaging, pricing, branding, and other executive functions

Concepts

    Its hard to be completely original and that’s okay, sometimes you have to borrow concepts from other people to make something new
    Even if something doesn’t work out, the experience you’ve gained from trying is better than if you hadn’t tried at all
