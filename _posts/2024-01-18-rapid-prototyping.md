What is it?

This is a class taught by Dr. Christopher Williams and it is about everything related to Additive Manufacturing the generation of suitable CAD models, current rapid prototyping fabrication technologies, their underlying material science, the use of secondary processing, and the impact of these technologies on society.
What have I done?

The class is split up into two parts: Learning about Additive Manufacturing, and applying that knowledge.
For the first part of the class, we went in-depth about the following AM processes:
Process:	Material Extrusion	Powder Bed Fusion	Vat Photo-polymerization	Binder Jetting	Material Jetting	Directed Energy Deposition	Sheet Lamination
What is it?	Putting a filament through a nozzle to achieve extrusion of material	Using an IR laser to selectively fuse powder together	Using a UV laser to cure a layer of resin, which then has to be post-processed	Depositing Binder using a print-head into a layer of powder. The green part must be cured, then sintered later	Depositing Material using a print-head onto a bed, then curing each layer	Feeding a material into either a laser or a wire, similar to welding	Material sheets are layer ontop of each other, cut using a laser or bond using binder and heat
Specifics Talked About?	Cooling, bed adhesion, warpage, layer strengths, direct ink write	Metal and polymer PBF, Amorphous vs Semi-crystalline polymers, shrinkage, energy density, coalescence and cooling	Thermoplastics vs Thermosets, top down vs bottom up, cure depth, critical exposure, depth of penetration, working curve	Porosity, process variables, primitives, drying and curing, sintering, binder saturation	Process overview	Wire vs Powder DED, inert gasses, uses, machining, thermal accumulation, warping, toolpathing solutions, Hybrid DED processes	Process overview, ultrasonic consolidation, multi-material laminates

The second half of the class is described as being “choose your own adventure”, where you choose 3 labs to do out of a selection of 15, as well as a final project. For my labs, I chose to learn about DED, PBF, and a new type of printing called Additive Friction Stir Deposition.
For AFSD, we took a tour to MELD Printworks which I can’t go into detail for, but I learned a lot about how a typical 3D printing company operates and what goes into analyzing if a part is good for use or not.
My next lab detailing how PBF parts are typically printed, what deformities they could encounter, and how best to avoid then. We talked specifically about coalescence and crystallization.
Lastly, I learned about DED (not done yet)
For my final project I was paired with 3 other students and we chose to design realistic rock climbing holds. This was because they are extremely expensive; they are currently made 20-25 units at a time with injection molding. It was identified that removing the cost of the mold and using AM could speed up the creation process and drive the price way down.

What have I learned from this?

Experience

    Knowledge of the advantages and weaknesses of the 7 main AM processes
    Knowledge of traditional manufacturing processes like injection molding, milling, etc.
    Specifics about Material Extrusion, PBF, and VPP processes
    Basic knowledge of nTop
    Learned to Design for AM

Concepts

    While it seems like AM is the future of manufacturing, in most scenarios it is cheaper and faster to create a part traditionally
    The price of AM includes buying the machine, similar to injection molding
    AM is typically used for things that either cannot be physically manufactured, or needs to be customized
